Tested 12/2/2023

Report (50%):


1. Goal of the project (5%):
     
     The primary goal is to create an interactive decision-based maze adventure. The project aims to implement a maze structure using tree data structure where each node represents a decision point. The user navigates through the maze by turning either left or right at each node, ultimately reaching either a "good end" or a "bad end" based on their choices.



2. Significance of the project (10%):

     The project potentailly enhances user engagement. Besides the maze, its Decision-based choice structure are commonly  used in various applications, from entertainment to education tools. It can serve as an engaging game that not only entertains users but also challenges them to think critically and make strategic decisions.
